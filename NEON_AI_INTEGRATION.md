# 🚀 Neon Database Integration with Python AI Backend

## **Overview**
Your Python AI backend is now fully integrated with the same Neon PostgreSQL database used by CHECKmate LMS. This means:

✅ **Single Database** - Both systems share the same data  
✅ **Real-time Sync** - AI results are stored in the database  
✅ **Enhanced Plagiarism Detection** - Compares against all submissions  
✅ **Advanced Grading** - Uses assignment rubrics from database

## **🔧 Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Install New Dependencies**
```bash
cd python_ai_backend
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install asyncpg
```

### **Step 2: Copy Database Connection**
```bash
# Copy your DATABASE_URL from main project to AI backend
copy ..\.env python_ai_backend\.env
```

### **Step 3: Restart AI Backend**
```bash
# Stop current AI backend (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart with database integration
py main.py
```

## **🎯 How It Works**

### **Database Integration Features:**

1. **Assignment Data Sync**
   - AI reads assignment details from database
   - Uses actual rubrics stored in assignments table
   - Accesses instructor and course information

2. **Enhanced Plagiarism Detection**
   - Compares against all previous submissions in database
   - Detects self-plagiarism (student's own previous work)
   - Identifies collusion (similar submissions from different students)
   - Stores plagiarism reports in database

3. **AI Results Storage**
   - Saves all AI grading results to database
   - Stores detailed feedback and scores
   - Tracks processing time and confidence levels

4. **Real-time Data Access**
   - AI can access student submission history
   - Reads assignment requirements and rubrics
   - Updates submission records with AI results

## **📊 Database Tables Used**

### **Existing Tables:**
- `assignments` - Assignment details and rubrics
- `submissions` - Student submissions with AI results
- `users` - Student and instructor information
- `courses` - Course information

### **New Tables Created:**
- `plagiarism_reports` - Detailed plagiarism analysis results

---

## **🧪 Testing the Integration**

### **Test 1: Create Assignment with Custom Rubric**
1. Login as instructor
2. Create new assignment with custom rubric:
   ```json
   {
     "content_quality": {"max_points": 35, "min_words": 150},
     "grammar_style": {"max_points": 25},
     "structure_organization": {"max_points": 25},
     "critical_thinking": {"max_points": 15}
   }
   ```

### **Test 2: Submit Assignment**
1. Login as student
2. Submit assignment with 200+ words
3. Watch AI processing with database integration

### **Test 3: Check Plagiarism Detection**
1. Submit similar content from different student
2. Verify plagiarism detection works
3. Check plagiarism reports in database

## **🚨 Troubleshooting**

### **If Database Connection Fails:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in `python_ai_backend/`
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
3. Ensure Neon database is accessible
4. Check network connectivity

### **If AI Results Not Saving:**
1. Check database connection logs
2. Verify `submissions` table exists
3. Check for permission issues

### **If Plagiarism Detection Not Working:**
1. Ensure `plagiarism_reports` table was created
2. Check if submissions exist in database
3. Verify plagiarism service is running
