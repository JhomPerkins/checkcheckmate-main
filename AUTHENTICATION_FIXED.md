# ✅ Authentication System Fixed!

Your login system is now fully functional and integrated with the database!

## 🎉 What's Working

### ✅ **Database Integration**
- Users are stored in PostgreSQL database
- Passwords are properly hashed with bcrypt
- All user data is persistent and secure

### ✅ **Authentication Features**
- **Login**: Users can log in with email/password/role
- **Registration**: New users can create accounts
- **Role-based Access**: Different roles (student, instructor, admin)
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed with salt rounds
- **Validation**: Proper input validation and error handling

### ✅ **API Endpoints**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

## 🔑 Test Credentials

You can now log in with these accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |

| **Instructor** | sarah.johnson@university.edu | password123 |
| **Student** | alice.smith@student.edu | password123 |
| **Admin** | admin@university.edu | password123 |

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Start the Application**
